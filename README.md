# Pathfinder
This repo is a personal learning project focussed on implementing some graph algorithms while improving my skills in:
- Algorithms and Datastructures
- The [Odin Programming Language](https://odin-lang.org/)
- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) as a dev environment

My main goal is to understand the algorithms and have some fun playing around...


## Further Ideas
When dealing with a graph with non-negative weighted edges, the [Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm) is the go-to algorithm with its $O(m + n log n)$ time bound on sparse graphs. Recently [Duan et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17033) presented a deterministic $O(m log^{2/3} n)$ -time algorithm for single-source shortest paths (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.
