# Pathfinder
An attempt to implement the algorithm described by [Duan et al. (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17033).

## Abstract
We give a deterministic $O(m log^{2/3} n)$ time algorithm for single-source shortest pathes (SSSP) on directed graphs with real non-negative edge weights in the comparison-addition model. This is the first result to break the $O(m + n log n)$ time bound of Dijkstra's algorithm on sparse graphs, showing that Dijkstra's algorithm is not optimal for SSSP.
